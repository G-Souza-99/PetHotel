The Purpose of the App
--------------
This app is aimed at fixing a small problem that few pet owners who move, travel or live in tiny apt buildings know. The hassle of finding someone to take your pet in for the duration of your travels, movings etc.. 

The app aims to fix this by providing a space for other pet lover users to add in their houses as an alternative for other pets to stay in for a short time.
As a frequent flyer I actually think this is an amazing solution.

This Rails Web-App was developed by [@G-Souza-99](https://github.com/G-Souza-99), [@louro-ines](https://github.com/louro-ines), [@catiafalagueira](https://github.com/catiafalagueira) and [@macafadeal](https://github.com/macafadeal) as part of a sprint in which we had to develop an app from start to finish. It was generated using the [lewagon templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates) during our time in the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com)

The idea was taken as an rbnb but for pets to stay instead of humans. This is a solution to a problem that only pet owners have.
